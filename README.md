Open Learning Load Testing
---

This package contains [`locust`](https://locust.io/) scripts for load testing various Open Learning applications.

**WARNING:** Most of these load tests write new data to applications, **DO NOT** run these against systems where you care about the data that's present, as you likely will want to wipe out the test data generated by these tests.


### Running

Setup the project: `poetry install`

You can run `locust` in a `poetry shell`

#### Discussions


```shell

# load test /learn/search, go to localhost:8089, enter the protocol/hostname for the app, and run your test
locust -f open_discussions/learn/search.py
```
